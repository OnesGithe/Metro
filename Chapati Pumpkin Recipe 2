   <li> Knead the flour well again and divide it into balls. 
     Dust the balls with some flour to avoid sticking on the surface.
     Flatten each ball and roll out thinly into sizeable circles.</li>
    <li>Heat an ungreased, heavy skillet or griddle over a medium flame.
      Lightly grease the pan and slowly heat the first chapati.

      then flip and cook the other side.Press the sides of the chapati
      with a spoon until it puffs.
    <li>Remove the chapati and place it in a warm dish or 
      foil paper and wrap it to keep it warm. Repeat this process for every chapati. </li>
